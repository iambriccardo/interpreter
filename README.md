# Simple Interpreter

This repository contains an implementation of the interpreter shown in the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).

The language is a simple interpreted programming language with its own runtime and my implementation has just a few more features than the original implementation such as context lines for errors.

The project was implemented just for fun and for learning, so it's not complete by any means.
